## 🎯 Executive Summary

Professional sports bettors and successful apps focus on **information asymmetry** - knowing things the average bettor doesn't. This document outlines the critical data points bettors need before placing a wager.

## 📊 The 12 Essential Data Points

### 1. **Best Available Odds (Line Shopping)**
- **What:** Compare odds across 15+ sportsbooks instantly
- **Why:** A -110 vs -105 difference = 2.3% better ROI long-term
- **Implementation:** Show best odds across DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, etc.
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - This alone can make bettors profitable

### 2. **Closing Line Value (CLV)**
- **What:** Did your bet beat the closing line?
- **Why:** THE single best predictor of long-term betting success
- **Example:** Bet Chiefs -3 at -110, closes at -3.5 at -115 = +CLV ✅
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Track CLV for all picks

### 3. **Line Movement History**
- **What:** How the line has moved since opening
- **Why:** Shows where sharp money is going
- **Display:** Graph showing open → current → close line
- **Signals:**
  - **Steam Move:** 1+ point move in <30 min = sharp action
  - **Reverse Line Movement:** Line moves opposite public betting
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### 4. **Public vs. Sharp Split**
- **What:** % of bets vs % of money on each side
- **Why:** "Fade the public" is a real edge
- **Example:** 75% of bets on Chiefs, but only 45% of money = Sharps on opponent
- **Key Metric:** When splits diverge by 20%+, that's a signal
- **Priority:** 🟠 HIGH
