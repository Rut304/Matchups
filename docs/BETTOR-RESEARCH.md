## 🎯 Executive Summary

Professional sports bettors and successful apps focus on **information asymmetry** - knowing things the average bettor doesn't. This document outlines the critical data points bettors need before placing a wager.

---

## 📊 The 12 Essential Data Points

### 1. **Best Available Odds (Line Shopping)**

- **What:** Compare odds across 15+ sportsbooks instantly
- **Why:** A -110 vs -105 difference = 2.3% better ROI long-term
- **Implementation:** Show best odds across DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, etc.
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - This alone can make bettors profitable

### 2. **Closing Line Value (CLV)**

- **What:** Did your bet beat the closing line?
- **Why:** THE single best predictor of long-term betting success
- **Example:** Bet Chiefs -3 at -110, closes at -3.5 at -115 = +CLV ✅
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Track CLV for all picks

### 3. **Line Movement History**

- **What:** How the line has moved since opening
- **Why:** Shows where sharp money is going
- **Display:** Graph showing open → current → close line
- **Signals:**
  - **Steam Move:** 1+ point move in <30 min = sharp action
  - **Reverse Line Movement:** Line moves opposite public betting
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### 4. **Public vs. Sharp Split**

- **What:** % of bets vs % of money on each side
- **Why:** "Fade the public" is a real edge
- **Example:** 75% of bets on Chiefs, but only 45% of money = Sharps on opponent
- **Key Metric:** When splits diverge by 20%+, that's a signal
- **Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

### 5. **Injury Reports (Real-Time)**

- **What:** Who's playing, who's out, who's questionable
- **Why:** A QB injury can swing a line 7+ points
- **Sources:** Official team reports, beat writers
- **Display:** Impact rating (High/Medium/Low) per injury
- **Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

### 6. **Weather Conditions**

- **What:** Wind, rain, temperature, indoor/outdoor

- **Sports:** NFL, MLB, Golf most affected
- **Display:** Weather icon + impact assessment
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (sport-dependent)

### 7. **Situational Angles**

- **What:** Patterns that historically affect outcomes
- **Examples:**

  - Revenge games (team facing former coach/player)
  - Division rivalries
  - Home dogs in primetime
  - Teams coming off a bye week
- **Priority:** 🟠 HIGH - These are real edges

### 8. **Historical Head-to-Head**

- **What:** Past matchup results between these specific teams
- **Why:** Some teams consistently cover/don't cover vs specific opponents
- **Display:** Last 5-10 matchups with ATS results
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

### 9. **ATS (Against The Spread) Records**

- **What:** Team's record covering the spread
- **Breakdowns Needed:**
  - Overall ATS record
  - Home/Away ATS
  - As Favorite/Underdog
  - ATS in last 10 games

- **Breakdowns Needed:**
  - Overall O/U record
  - Home/Away O/U
  - Primetime O/U
  - O/U streak
- **Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

### 11. **Key Numbers (Sport-Specific)**

- **NBA:** 5, 7, 9 (OT effects)
- **NHL:** 1, 2 (low-scoring)
- **MLB:** 1, 2 runs
- **Why:** Line value changes dramatically at key numbers
- **Display:** Highlight when line is ON a key number
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

### 12. **Referee/Umpire Trends**
